## 📚 Project Description
This project implements a Python application for visualizing both informed and uninformed search strategies in maze environments. The main goal is to demonstrate how various search algorithms explore and navigate through complex, randomly generated mazes.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Algorithm Implementations:** BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), A* (A-Star)
- **Real-time Visualization:** Smooth animation using Pygame for real-time exploration
- **Customizable Maze:** Dynamic maze generation with adjustable start, end, and obstacle placement
- **Performance Comparison:** Visual comparison of search efficiency

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core logic and algorithm implementations
- **Pygame:** Graphical representation and user interaction
